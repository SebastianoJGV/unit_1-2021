# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

The owner of the local game shop is an enthusiast of classic computer games. He has been looking for a talented programmer that can help him revive his passion for text-based games. He has few requirements for this task:

1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.

Apart for this requirements, the owner is open to any type of game, topic or genre.

## Proposed Solution

I am going to create a Pokemon based text game, this will allow you to play against a freind on the same PC or against a CPU using the 3 base pokemon types of fire, water, and grass.

I will design and make a text based game for Mr. Ruben Pinzon. The game will be about pokemon and is constructed using the software python, running on the eclipse pydev IDE. It will take 2 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria shown below.

## Success Criteria
1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.
4. Run with at least the "perfect triangle" of elements and choice of what element to play as. (Fire, Water, Grass)
5. CPU integration
6. Database integration for numerous save states

# Criteria B: Design

## System Diagram

As shown in **Fig. 1**, the solution will run on python and is developed using the Eclipse IDE. The code it designed on windows but can run on a mac computer with python 3.0 installed as well.
